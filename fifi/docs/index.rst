Fifi Documentation
==================

Fifi is a library for finite field arithmetics. It provides an optimized
implementation for operations in various finite fields, such as GF(2),
GF(2⁴), GF(2⁸) and GF(2¹⁶). To provide high performance, it
utilizes a wide range of hardware optimizations for the different fields,
especially the SIMD instruction sets of modern CPUs.

The Fifi repository: https://github.com/steinwurf/fifi

The ``examples`` folder contains some programs that demonstrate the usage
of the available API.

If you have any questions or suggestions about this library, please contact
us at our developer mailing list (hosted at Google Groups):
