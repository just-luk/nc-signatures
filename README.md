Authentication Schemes for Network Coding

### What is this?

Code for the implementation and performance evaluation of authentication schemes for network coding.

### Why is this important?

Network coding is a largely theoretical field. However, it is important to understand the performance of various authentication schemes to determine the best one for a given network. I've implemented 3 authentication schemes for network coding, which are listed below.
