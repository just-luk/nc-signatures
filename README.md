Authentication Schemes for Network Coding

### What is this?

Code for the implementation and performance evaluation of authentication schemes for network coding. (It's very messy, but it's the best I could do with my limited C++ knowledge.)

### Why is this important?

Network coding is a largely theoretical field. However, it is important to understand the performance of various authentication schemes to determine the best one for a given network. I've implemented 4 authentication schemes for network coding, which are listed below.
